This showed the updated website with the working links at the top, I was having trouble when I clicked one of them but after some debugging I fixed the issue and when clicked it took me down to where it was suppose to go.
---
New ALT attributes were added for every image and background image explaining what the imaage represents on a metphorical level and what it literally shows word for word.
---
Changed all the divs to make it sematic code and be easier to comprehend and read when going over the code.
---
The Horiseon website is fully opperational and working now. It is comprehensive with the semantics, all the links working properly on the nav bar. All the images have ALT attributes as well as the background images explaining everything.
